##  About The Project

This project combines a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a clean web interface to classify various types of skin lesions. Users can upload an image of a skin lesion, and the AI model will provide a prediction for one of several diagnostic categories.

**Medical Disclaimer:** This is an academic and experimental project. The predictions made by this application are for informational purposes only and are **not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment**. Always seek the advice of a qualified dermatologist or healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.

##  Key Features

* **AI-Powered Classification:** Leverages a deep learning model for lesion classification.
* **Simple Web Interface:** Intuitive file upload functionality.
* **Instant Results:** Provides a classification prediction and a confidence score.
* **Modular Code:** Includes a `model_loader.py` for cleanly loading the trained model.

---

##  Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Flask
* **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

##  Dataset Information

The model is trained on the **ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection** challenge dataset ("Task 3: Lesion Diagnosis").

To train the model or run the application with full context, you will need to download the following components into a local `data/` directory (which you should create):

1.  **Image Data:** The primary dataset of skin lesion images.
    * **Source:** [ISIC 2018 Challenge Data](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018)
    * **Required File:** `ISIC2018_Task3_Training_Input.zip`
        ![ISIC 2018 Dataset Download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ded26b9a-1150-48a2-8ee2-705a8367cef8)

2.  **Metadata File:** Contains labels and other information for each image.
    * **Source:** [metadata.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkalbl/RevisitingSkinToneFairness/main/data/ISIC2018/ISIC2018_Task3_Training_Input/metadata.csv)

3.  **Corrected Metadata:** An additional file with corrected data points.
    * **Source:** [Bevan_corrected.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkalbl/RevisitingSkinToneFairness/main/Bevan_corrected.csv)

##  Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+ and `pip`
* Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-github-username/skin-disease-classification.git](https://github.com/your-github-username/skin-disease-classification.git)
    cd skin-disease-classification
    ```

2.  **Set up Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Download the Model:**
    Make sure your trained model file (e.g., `model.h5`) is placed inside the `models/` directory. If it's stored elsewhere (like Git LFS or a cloud drive), download it into that folder.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the Web App:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the port specified in your `app.py`).
